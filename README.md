## Build Instructions

The module's build system uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and requires [Python](https://www.python.org) (tested with 2.7). Make sure they're installed, then run CMake, and build the generated solution file.

Only Windows support has been tested, though Linux builds should also be possible.
